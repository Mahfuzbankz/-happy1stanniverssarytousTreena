        There are moments in life when words fail to capture the depth of
        emotions, but I will try my best. Having you by my side has been the
        greatest gift I could have ever asked for. You’ve brought so much light
        into my life, and I can’t help but smile when I think about the journey
        we’ve shared.

        When I was at my lowest, with no one to turn to, you were there. Your
        presence, your love, and your understanding gave me the strength to
        carry on. For that, I will be forever grateful. You’ve shown me what it
        truly means to be loved unconditionally, and I can't thank you enough
        for always standing by me.

        I know that we’ve had our share of ups and downs, and I’m deeply sorry
        for any hurt caused along the way. Every challenge has only made me
        appreciate you more, and I want you to know that I’m committed to
        growing, learning, and making things right whenever we falter.

        that I am.
